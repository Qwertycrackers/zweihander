***The Abyssal Dagger of Chaviadeth

**Backstory
Back in the days of the ancients, there were three gods. Time, Life, and Darkness. These titans thrashed and created a world of constant turmoil. Evantually the God of Time and Life were able to bring the God of Darkness under control and allowed life on Earth to thrive. But in time, Darkness grew with the hate humans felt for eachother and became too much for the gods to manage, the humans found their Heros and with the help of the gods banished Darkness into the newly formed Abyssal Realm. This act severly weakened both god's powers and they were forced to leave earth and enter the Ethereal Realm. 

Before Darkness was banished, it had a dagger created that allowed it to slice between worlds so it could reak more havoc. But the dagger failed to protect it from the Heroes and Gods and Darkness was split into three beings, Chaos, Violence, and Death. Thus, the Dagger of Chaviadeth was born. None know where the dagger went after Darkness' banishment but none have seen it for thousands of years, some say it doesn't exist.

**Functionality
The dagger has Abyssal inscribed into it, the language of Darkness. When spoken aloud and slashed, it tears a hole into the dimension of the spoken language, Abyssal, Ethereal, Material, or other. The more anger the person feels weilding it, the stronger it is, every swing gains a person 1 corruption and the more chaos ranks someone has, the stronger it is. It has an attraction for evil and people who cause or are close to crime.

When more than 3 people die in its presence, it glows vibrant black and makes people nearby have dark visions.
