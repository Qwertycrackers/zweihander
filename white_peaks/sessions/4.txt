Session 4
Peter, Ivan, and Jake continue travelling down the road off to the side to avoid detection and evantually they come upon a small clearing filled with bloodied bodies. Most of the bodies have cloaks with the symbol of the Custodian, although there are some Screeling bodies intermixed. They see a tall man digging graves and burying every body, normal and Screeling alike. They inquire upon the man and find out he is Nayum, a 6'4 138lbs elf. Jake resists having a seizure upon seeing an elf for the first time. Nayum reveals he is a cult leader for the Cult of the Custodian, but a band of Screelings came and slaughtered all of them except him. He decides to join the party on the adventure to vanquish the Screelings. All four finally arrive at a farmhouse that has been taken over by the Screelings and made into a camp. The party notices that there are mercenaries coming and going and decide to disguise themselves as mercenaries. They slip into camp without making a scene in the dead of night. They swing by the healing tent and decide to take a bunch of bandages(17). They then investgated the rest of the camp and found standard camp suppplies like food and weapons. The party decided to make their way into the Farmhouse through a side door only guarded by 1 Screeling, the Screeling didn't believe they were supposed to enter. Nayum then turned and bellowed at Jake and induced a seizure, as Jake flailed around helplessly Peter informed the guard that he had Demon's Gonorea and he needed to go inside. The guard quickly complied and let them inside. They found themselves in a small entrance way without any things of importance in them. When entering the next room, the main Living room of the house, they noticed a mercenary planner in the corner standing above some plans. They approached him and he immediatly noticed that Nayum was an elf. He inquired as to their buisness here and Nayum responded poorly saying they are here for money and comradary. Doern as they learned, drew his sword asked why they were in the house. They didn't respond and attempted to intimidate him, Nayum, Peter, and Ivan tried to strike an imposing stance but instead looked like drunk cheerleaders and Doern became angered and stabbed Nayum in the arm. They exchanged blows and Doern dashed away from them and then seized Jake in a chokehold and put his knife to his throat. Nayum continued unswayed by this threat and threw 2 daggers at Doern. One clinked off his armor and one missed. Peter had had enough and dashed and tackled Doern to the ground forced everyone involved prone, from there, Nayum and others knocked Doern unconscious. Peter then had the genious idea to have Jake sneak out the window and go hide in the forest and they stuffed Doern in a sack and they walked out from whence they came. They informed the guard that they had to put Jake down from Demon's Gonorrea, the guard was very sorry and offered to escort them out of the camp and help bury the body, they made it out of camp without a problem but as they were walking into the forest, the guard began to put 2 and 2 together that something wasn't right. Peter whipped around and blasted his head off with his viscous blunderbus.
