***Alek Moonshine

I grew up poor with an unloving family. I tried to make it by stealing from others and it worked, for a time. It just wasn’t enough. But then a buddy got me into my real passion: stealin from dead people. In my small lowly shitty town the common belief was that whatever you were buried with would come with you to the afterlife. This made things easy. My buddy and I started stealing from the mass graves of peasants and lower than nobodies. Then we worked our way up to the more wealthy once we got a handle on things. We were doing well for ourselves. Until that night. That night when he was busy and I just couldn’t wait. I needed the money. We had talked about hitting the tomb of a high up diplomat. I decided to take our plans and do it by myself. That night forever changed me. I saw something in that tomb that night. I saw magic. It changed everything. I had finally found my real calling. I was on the road traveling just hitting up every grave site and tomb I could find, until I ran into these guys on a quest to find some kidnapped loser. I decided to help out because apparently he was a very important loser. I figured that if I can help take him back to wherever he is, I could help myself out a bit in the process. Although magic is lovely and all, I still have a love for stealing…. Maybe this kid’s ancestors had some business in the magic world. I can only find out by getting him back to where he belongs and doing what I do best, sneaking around and stealing.
