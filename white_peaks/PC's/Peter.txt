***Peter

I was born in the hayloft of Ivan the Swag's father's(Reginald Swag) manor during a harrowing winter. My father was a swine herd and my mother was a fish seller on the docks. Naturally, I was given the opportunity to become a coachman by Lord Swag in the insistence that I look after his son who went into the dragoon cavalry. I was a cam follower for a number of years - I shoed horses and organized munitions. I only follow lord Swag because his father paid to have my father buried in a cemetery after my father caught a horrible case of Sailor's Rot. My mother still lives but she is venerable. I acquired my blunderbuss ina bet on a cock fight and learned to use ranged weapons during downtime in the dragoon forces as a servant.
