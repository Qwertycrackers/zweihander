***Benard the Gryffin Slayer

As a young boy I watched my parents get slaughtered by a pair of drunken Skreeling warriors. From that moment on I swore vengence upon their graves. I took to the streets to begin my training, wielding my father's favorite weapon he crafted himself. Soon I found myself in the sparing ring fighting for glory and cash. I quickly rose through the ranks of pit fighters, my rage smoldering all the time. One day the tournament hosts decided to bring in a creature most deemed unkillable, the Gryffin. We exchanged blows quickly in a volley of up close combat. The Gryffin then made a diving swipe at me scraping my face and forever making me remeber that battle. After taking that blow, I swung my axe low and dismembered the Gryffin. I still carry that Gryffin's talon around my neck. I now believe I am ready to fight the Skreelings and turn the tide of the world against them.
